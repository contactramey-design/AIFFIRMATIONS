# 🚀 Simple Web Start - No QR Code Needed!

## ✅ IGNORE THE QR CODE
The QR code is **only for mobile phones** using the Expo Go app. You don't need it for web!

## 🎯 Start Web Version (Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Open Terminal
Open Terminal app on your Mac.

### Step 2: Run This Command
```bash
cd /Users/sydneyrenay/AI.firmations
npm run web
```

### Step 3: WAIT 1-2 Minutes
Watch the terminal. You'll see:
- "Starting Metro Bundler" ✅
- "Starting Webpack" ✅
- "Compiling..." ⏳
- "✓ Compiled successfully" ✅
- **"Web is waiting on http://localhost:19006"** ✅

### Step 4: Open Browser
**ONLY AFTER** you see "Web is waiting on http://localhost:19006", open:
```
http://localhost:19006
```

## ⚠️ Important

1. **Keep terminal open** - Closing it stops the server
2. **Wait for compilation** - Don't open browser too early
3. **Ignore QR code** - It's for mobile, not web
4. **Blank page?** - Check browser console (Cmd+Option+I) for errors

## 🐛 If Blank Page

1. **Open browser console**: Press Cmd+Option+I
2. **Look for red errors**
3. **Share the errors** with me

## 🎉 That's It!

Just run `npm run web` and wait. The QR code is irrelevant for web development.

---

**Run this now**: `npm run web` and wait for "Web is waiting" message!
