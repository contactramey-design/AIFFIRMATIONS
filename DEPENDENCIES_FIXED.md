# ✅ Dependencies Fixed!

## What Was Fixed

1. **Restored Expo** from 54.0.33 → **51.0.0** (original version)
2. **Restored React Native** from 0.84.0 → **0.74.0** (original version)
3. **Fixed babel-preset-expo** from 54.0.10 → **11.0.0** (compatible with Expo 51)
4. **Removed** `@babel/preset-env` (not needed)
5. **Cleaned and reinstalled** all dependencies

## ✅ Current Versions

- **Expo**: ~51.0.0
- **React**: 18.2.0
- **React Native**: 0.74.0
- **babel-preset-expo**: ~11.0.0

## 🚀 Ready to Run!

Now you can start the web server:

```bash
npm run web
```

Or start the regular dev server:

```bash
npm start
```

Then press `w` to open web version.

## ⚠️ Note About Vulnerabilities

The `npm audit` warnings are expected and mostly in development dependencies. They won't affect your app's functionality. **Do NOT run `npm audit fix --force` again** as it will break your setup.

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Start the web server:**
   ```bash
   npm run web
   ```

2. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for first compilation

3. **Open** http://localhost:19006 in your browser

**Everything is fixed and ready to go!** 🎉
