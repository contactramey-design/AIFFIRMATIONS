# 🎯 What To Do RIGHT NOW

## You're Seeing:
- QR code (ignore it)
- "Web is waiting on http://localhost:8081" (wrong port!)
- Menu with options

## ✅ DO THIS:

### In Your Terminal Window:

1. **Look at the menu** - you should see "Press w | open web"
2. **Press the letter `w`** (lowercase, just the letter)
3. **WAIT 30-60 seconds**
4. **Look for**: "Web is waiting on http://localhost:19006"
5. **Open**: http://localhost:19006 in your browser

## 📝 Step by Step:

```
Terminal shows:
> Press w | open web

YOU: Press 'w'

Terminal shows:
Starting Webpack...
Compiling...
✓ Compiled successfully
Web is waiting on http://localhost:19006

YOU: Open http://localhost:19006 in browser
```

## ⚠️ Important:

- **QR Code** = Ignore completely (mobile only)
- **Port 8081** = Wrong, ignore it
- **Port 19006** = Correct, this is your app
- **Press 'w'** = Starts the web version

---

**RIGHT NOW**: In your terminal, **press `w`** and wait!
